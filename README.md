# Learn Cpp

## Description

This repo is dedicated to my work on https://www.learncpp.com/ to upskill my cpp and learn more technical details about the language.
I have worked with the language already but it has mostly been hacky projects and is missing the nuance and know how I would like to have with the language.

## Goal

To update this repo a minimum of 3 times per week until I have worked through the entire course. Afterwards I will be pursuing cpp and go projects in my freetime
after work, hopefully also a minimum of 3 days per week.

## About Me

I am currently employed as a web developer at the IRCC who mainly works with Typescript in Node/NestJS and Angular. I am interested in pursuing more challenging projects
such as graphics simulation and game development, so learning cpp is a must. I also have an interest in network development, primarily from my gaming hobby, so I have learned the basics of Go, which I hope to use in tandem with cpp to create multiplayer experiences, or at the very least a cool portfolio in web assembly.

### Conclusion

I believe the rest of the book (and even much of what I've done) is review. I've learned all the basic concepts and more complex ones now (smart pointers, references, structs, etc...) and am ready to proceed with my existing knowledge of oop. I will no longer be working through this book and will start my first C++ project Wdnesday December 21st
