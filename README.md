# Learn Cpp

## Description

    This repo is dedicated to my work on https://www.learncpp.com/ to upskill my cpp and learn more technical details about the language.
    I have worked with the language already but it has mostly been hacky projects and is missing the nuance and know how I would like to have with the language.

## Goal

    To update this repo a minimum of 3 times per week until I have worked through the entire course. Afterwards I will be pursuing cpp and go projects in my freetime
    after work, hopefully also a minimum of 3 days per week.

### About Me

    I am currently employed as a web developer at the IRCC who mainly works with Typescript in Node/NestJS and Angular. I am interested in pursuing more challenging projects
    such as graphics simulation and game development, so learning cpp is a must. I also have an interest in network development, primarily from my gaming hobby, so I have learned the basics of Go, which I hope to use in tandem with cpp to create multiplayer experiences, or at the very least a cool portfolio in web assembly.
